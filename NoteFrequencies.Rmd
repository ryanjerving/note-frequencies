## Intro

**Musical improvisation and composition** can seem like a mysterious thing -- and quite a leap from simply playing pre-scripted notes on a page of written music.

And, yet, most of us do it pretty un-self-consciously all the time as we hum, whistle, or la-de-da sing to ourselves -- or, in my case, to my dog and cat when I'm feeding them in the morning -- and we're never at a loss for what note to play next. 

How is that we seem know without thinking about it much what things are going to sound right as we spontaneously compose like this? Where does "inspirado" come from? And how far is it from being able to whistle, hum, or sing to being able to translate that act of *improvisatory composition* to an instrument?

This project tries to take one small step for a Viper -- but one giant leap for Viper-kind -- toward demystifying the process of **how to make stuff up**. I hope to show you that, at some really basic level, you're not actually working without a net out there on the highwire once you step off the platform of written notes. In fact, if you know even a little bit about the `key`, the `chords`, and the `style` of the music you're playing, you'll find a number of more-or-less slip-proof platforms to serve you as landings all along the rope.

How about we take that first doozy of a step!

## Notes and Notes and Notes and Notes

So here's the first couple of lines of the melody of **"Another Day,"** a new song that the Viper will premiere with the **Chamber Orchestra** of the **Lake Zurich Middle School North** orchestra program led by **Mr. Riley Broach**. (This is part of the program's annual Spring Concert happening on Thursday, May 17 at 7:00 p.m. -- the Viper will be doing a piece with **Intermezzo Orchestra** as well.) Looking at it (in treble, alto, and bass clefs!), it goes like this:

What can we learn from this snippet? First of all, we can learn that the Viper wrote this in the `key` of G Major (or, possible, E Minor). 

How do we know that? Well, the key signature tells us -- one sharp means that the "legal" notes in this key are the essentially the white keys of the piano (with one exception): `G`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, and `F-sharp`.

But it's interesting to note that science has shown that your ear and your brain would tell you even without seeing the key signature, just from hearing the collection of notes, where they land relative to the measures and the phrasing, and how often they occur. (I know "science has shown" sounds weaselly, but see Daniel Levitin's book, *This Is Your Brain On Music* to see that I'm actually getting this from somewhere.)

In other words, if I sang this song to you -- even without playing the chords -- and then asked you to hum the "home" note, most of you would get it right and hum a `G`.

To see what material your brain is working with, let's look at just the question of frequency -- or, rather, let's let a processing machine look at it. 

I wrote a little counting script in Python and fed it the notes for the lead sheet version of the melody that I'd earlier given the LZOrk musicians (you can get the treble clef it [here]<docs/Another_Day_Violin.pdf>) -- taking all repeats as written, tied notes counted only as a single note -- and then recorded the results to a csv spreadsheet at <https://github.com/ryanjerving/note-frequencies/blob/master/datasets/another-day-frequency.csv>. Then I had it rendered into the chart below using a data science environment called R. 

```{r another-day-note-frequency-plot}

# Use R to read in "Another Day" note count data from csv stored in in GitHub documents for project.
# We'll call this new data object "ad" (for "Another Day")

ad <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanjerving/note-frequencies/master/datasets/another-day-frequency.csv")

# Plot bar chart of "ad" showing each scale note by its frequency appearing, with fill color reflecting this as well.

ggplot(ad, aes(x = Note, y = Frequency, fill = Frequency)) + geom_col()


```

Or, if you want to see the raw numbers, they look like this:

```{r another-day-note-frequency-table}

knitr::kable(ad)

```

## Analysis

Okay, great. But what does this tell you about your choices: which notes are landing notes, which notes are tightrope notes.

Some surprises here.
