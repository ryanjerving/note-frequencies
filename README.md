# note-frequencies

This projects pulls together materials, code, and rendering that explores how often each note of the 12-tone Western scale appears in the melodies of some sample Viper songs as performed by the Orchestras of Lake Zurich Middle School North. 

The idea is to de-mystify the related processes of improvising and composing by giving students a sense of the "safest" notes in any given song, as well as a sense of which notes are likely to be more often using as passing tones or "flavor" notes.

A fully rendered html version of the project is available through RPubs.com at <http://rpubs.com/ryanjerving/note-frequencies-in-viper-songs>

It would be fun to expand this at some point to consider how note choice relates to chord changes, or how frequently a given note precedes or follows other notes.
